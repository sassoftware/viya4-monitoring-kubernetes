# SAS速 Viya速 Monitoring for Kubernetes

SAS速 Viya速 Monitoring for Kubernetes provides simple scripts and customization
options to deploy monitoring, alerts, and log aggregation for SAS Viya 4.x.

Monitoring and logging may be deployed independently or together. There are
no hard dependencies between the two.

## Monitoring - Metrics and Alerts

The monitoring solution includes these components:

- [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)
  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
  - [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/)
  - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
- Prometheus Exporters
  - [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
  - [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
  - [Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter)
  - [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway)
- Alert definitions
- Grafana dashboards
  - Kubernetes cluster monitoring
  - SAS CAS Overview
  - SAS Java Services
  - SAS Go Services
  - RabbitMQ
  - Postgres
  - Fluent Bit
  - Elasticsearch
  - Istio
  - NGINX

This is an example of a Grafana dashboard for cluster monitoring.

See the documentation at [SAS Viya: Monitoring](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=calmonitoring&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm)
for more information about using the monitoring components.

## Logging - Aggregation, Searching, & Filtering

The logging solution includes these components:

- [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)
  - Custom Fluent Bit parsers
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
  - Custom index pattern for logs
  - Namespace separation
  - [Elasticsearch Exporter](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch-exporter)
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)
  - Custom Kibana dashboards

  This is an example of a Kibana dashboard displaying log message volumes.

See the documentation at [SAS Viya: Logging](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=callogging&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm)
for more information about using the logging components.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster that meets the prerequisites for SAS Viya
- [Helm](https://helm.sh) version 3.x
- `kubectl` with cluster-admin access
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 1.8 or later
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## Installation

### Monitoring

See the [monitoring README](monitoring/README.md) to deploy the monitoring
components, including Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana,
metric exporters, service monitors, and custom dashboards.

### Logging

See the [logging README](logging/README.md) to deploy the logging components,
including Fluent Bit, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

## Customization

The process of customizing the monitoring and logging deployments consists of: 
- creating the location for your local customization files
- using the `USER_DIR` environment variable to specify the location of the customization files
- copying the customization files from one of the provided samples to your local directory
- specifying customization variables and parameters in the customization files

### Creating the Location for Customization Files

The `USER_DIR` environment variable enables you to use a directory outside of the local repository to contain the customization files. By using a location outside of the repository, you can put the customization files in a location that is under version control, and you can preserve your customizations when you deploy new versions of the monitoring and logging applications. You could also create different sets of configuration files for different cluster types, and then use the `USER_DIR` variable to specify the configuration files to use based on the cluster type on which you were deploying.

For example, to create a customization directory named *my-viya4mon-user-dir* that contains directories for monitoring and logging customization files:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/my-viya4mon-user-dir/monitoring
mkdir -p ~/my-viya4mon-user-dir/logging
```

Note that these commands create a customization directory tree in the current user's home directory.

### Using USER_DIR to Specify the Location of Customization Files

Use the `USER_DIR` environment variable to specify the root location of your local customization files.

This example sets the `USER_DIR` environment variable to the *my-viya4mon-user-dir* directory:

```bash
export USER_DIR=~/my-viya4mon-user-dir
```
The monitoring and logging deployment scripts use the customization files contained in the directories under the `USER_DIR` location.

### <a name="customization"></a>Specifying Customization Variables and Parameters

After you create the location for your customization files, you can customize the components that you deploy for monitoring and logging by specifying environment variables and Helm chart parameters in this set of customization files (in this example, contained in the *my-viya4mon-user-dir* root directory):

```text
my-viya4mon-user-dir/user.env

my-viya4mon-user-dir/monitoring/user.env
my-viya4mon-user-dir/monitoring/user-values-prom-operator.yaml
my-viya4mon-user-dir/monitoring/user-values-pushgateway.yaml

my-viya4mon-user-dir/logging/user.env
my-viya4mon-user-dir/logging/user-values-elasticsearch-open.yaml
my-viya4mon-user-dir/logging/user-values-es-exporter.yaml
my-viya4mon-user-dir/logging/user-values-fluent-bit-open.yaml
```

You specify the environment variables in the `user.env` files and the Helm chart parameters in the `*.yaml` configuration files. 

You do not have to specify values in all of these files. The deployment process ignores any files in the `USER_DIR` other than these.

#### Using Sample Configuration Files

In order to minimize the potential for errors, you should not manually create the customization files, but use one of the set of sample files as the starting point for your own customizations. 

If your situation matches one of the specialized samples, you can copy the configuration files for the sample that most closely matches your environment from the repository to your customization file directory. This enables you to start your customization with a set of values that are valid for your situation. You can then make further modifications to the files.

If your situation does not match any of the specialized samples, copy the `generic-base` sample as a base for your customization files, and then change the values or copy values from other samples to match your environment. See the [generic-base README](samples/generic-base/README.md).

If more than one sample applies to your environment, you can manually copy the values from the other sample files to the files in your customization directory.

See the [samples README](samples/README.md) for a list of the provided samples.

#### Specifying Environment Variables in user.env Files

Environment variables control script behavior and high-level options such as TLS and workload node placement. Note that you can also specify environment variables on a command line, but specifying the variables in `user.env` is recommended, in order to maintain a consistent set of values for future deployments. The values in the top-level `user.env` file (`/my-viya4mon-user-dir/user.env`) apply to both the monitoring and logging deployments. The values in `/my-viya4mon-user-dir/monitoring/user.env` apply only to the monitoring deployment and the values in `/my-viya4mon-user-dir/logging/user.env` apply only to the logging deployment.

See the [monitoring README](monitoring/README.md) and [logging README](logging/README.md) for information about determining valid values for the `user.env` and `*.yaml` files.

### Default StorageClass

The default cluster StorageClass is used for both monitoring and logging
unless the value is overidden in the  `user-*.yaml` files for monitoring or
logging. The deployment scripts issue a warning if no default StorageClass is
available, even if the value is properly set by the user. In this case,
you can safely ignore the warning.
