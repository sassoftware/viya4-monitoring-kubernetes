## Overview
SAS® Viya® Monitoring for Kubernetes provides scripts and customization
options to deploy metric monitoring, alerts, and log-message aggregation for SAS® Viya®.

- SAS® Viya® (previously called SAS Visual Machine Learning)
- SAS® Viya® Advanced (previously called SAS Visual Data Science)
