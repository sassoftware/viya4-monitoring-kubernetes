# SAS® Viya® Monitoring for Kubernetes

SAS® Viya® Monitoring for Kubernetes provides scripts and customization
options to deploy metric monitoring, alerts, and log-message aggregation for SAS® Viya®.

**Note:** The documentation included in this GitHub project uses "SAS Viya" to refer to the SAS Viya platform and compatible SAS Viya applications, including these products:
- SAS® Viya® (previously called SAS Visual Machine Learning)
- SAS® Viya® Advanced (previously called SAS Visual Data Science)
- SAS® Viya® Programming (previously called SAS Visual Data Science Programming)
- SAS® Viya® Enterprise (previously called SAS Visual Data Science Decisioning)

Log monitoring and metric monitoring can be deployed independently or together. There are no hard dependencies between the two.
