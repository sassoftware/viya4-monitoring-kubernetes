        annotations:
          description:
            Check to see that the CAS pod existed for a short time. This implies
            that CAS pod has restarted for whatever the reason. Will need to further investigate
            the cause.
          summary:
            The current CAS (sas-cas-server-default-controller) pod < 15 minutes
            in existence. Mostly likely it is due to restart of the CAS pod.

      - title: CAS Memory Usage High
        annotations:
          description:
            Checks the CAS memory usage. If it is > 300GB, it will alert. Currently,
            max. memory is 512GB. The expectation is that this alert will be an early
            warning sign to investigate large memory usage as typical usage is less than
            the threshold. Want to prevent OOMkill of CAS.
          summary:
            CAS memory > 300GB. This can be due to a program or pipeline taking
            all the available memory.
