# Chart: https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/opendistro-build/tree/master/helm
# Default values: https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/opendistro-build/blob/master/helm/opendistro-es/values.yaml

# NOTES:
#     * When "master" nodes are also serving as "data" nodes they will need more disk space than needed when they are
#       only  serving as "master" nodes.  The value of the master.persistence.size value shown below takes this into
#       account.  However, you should review the setting and adjust it as necessary.
#
#     * When multi-purpose Elasticsearch nodes are used, there is generally no reason to deploy additional nodes
#       performing only a single capability.  However, if that is necessary for your particular use-case it is
#       possible to adjust the configuration below to do so.
#
#            * If adding "data" nodes, uncomment the data stanza below and update the replicas value to specify
#              the number of _additional_ data nodes needed.  Remember that the master nodes will continue to
#              serve as data nodes as well.
#
#            * If adding "client" nodes, uncomment the client stanza below and update the replicas value to specify
#              the number of _additional_ client nodes needed.  Remember that the master nodes will continue to
#              serve as client nodes as well.
