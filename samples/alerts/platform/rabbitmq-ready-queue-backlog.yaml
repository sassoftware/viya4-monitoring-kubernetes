          description:
            Checks for accumulation of Rabbitmq ready messages > 10,000. The  covers potential orphan
            queues and/or bottlenecking of queues due to catalog service.
          summary:
            Rabbitmq ready messages > 10,000. This means there is a large backlog
            of messages due to high activity (which can be temporary) or something has
            gone wrong.
