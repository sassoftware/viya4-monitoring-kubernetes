          description:
            Checks for the Ready state of sas-readiness pod. Will need to check
            the status of the Viya pods since sas-readiness pod reflects the health of
            the Viya services.
          summary:
            sas-readiness pod is not in Ready state. This means that one or more
            of the Viya services are not in a good state.
