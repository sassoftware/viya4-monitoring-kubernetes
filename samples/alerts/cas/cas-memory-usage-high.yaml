      - title: CAS Memory Usage High
        annotations:
          description:
            Checks the CAS memory usage. If it is > 300GB, it will alert. Currently,
            max. memory is 512GB. The expectation is that this alert will be an early
            warning sign to investigate large memory usage as typical usage is less than
            the threshold. Want to prevent OOMkill of CAS.
          summary:
            CAS memory > 300GB. This can be due to a program or pipeline taking
            all the available memory.
