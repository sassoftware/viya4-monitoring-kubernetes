          description:
            Check to see that the CAS pod existed for a short time. This implies
            that CAS pod has restarted for whatever the reason. Will need to further investigate
            the cause.
          summary:
            The current CAS (sas-cas-server-default-controller) pod < 15 minutes
            in existence. Mostly likely it is due to restart of the CAS pod.
