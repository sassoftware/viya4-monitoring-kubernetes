# Samples

Samples are provided to demonstrate how to customize the deployment
of the logging and monitoring components for specific situations. The samples
provide instructions, files, and scripts, as appropriate.

Some samples use the deployment customization process, while others deploy
specialized components to support specific scenarios.

## Customization-Based Samples

Samples are provided to demonstrate how to customize the deployment of the
logging and monitoring components for specific situations. The samples provide
instructions, example yaml files that you can modify to fit your environment,
and scripts, as appropriate. Although each example focuses on a specific
scenario, you can combine multiple samples by merging the appropriate values in
each deployment file.

You customize your logging deployment by specifying values in `user.env` and
`*.yaml` files. These files are stored in a local directory outside of your
repository that is identified by the `USER_DIR` environment variable. 
For information about the customization process, see the
[monitoring README](../monitoring/README.md#mon_custom) or 
[Pre-deployment for Logging](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=callogging&docsetTarget=p1j31coiuoun6mn1om73shkcq4ut.htm) in the SAS Viya Administration Help Center.

The customization files in each sample provide a starting point for the
customization files for a deployment that supports a specific situation.

In order to minimize the potential for errors, you should not manually create
the customization files, but use one of these sample files as the starting
point for your own customizations.

If your situation matches one of the specialized samples, you can copy the
customization files for the sample that most closely matches your environment
from the repository to your customization file directory. This enables you to
start your customization with a set of values that are valid for your
situation. You can then make further modifications to the files.

If your situation does not match any of the specialized samples, copy the
`generic-base` sample as a base for your customization files, and then change
the values or copy values from other samples to match your environment.

If more than one sample applies to your environment, you can manually copy the
values from the other sample files to the files in your customization directory.

After you finish modifying the configuration files, deploy monitoring and
logging using the standard deployment scripts.
