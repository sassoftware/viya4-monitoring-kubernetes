# TLS-Enabling SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes

With the 1.2.15 (18JUL23) release, the components of SAS Viya Monitoring for Kubernetes 
are deployed with TLS *enabled by default*.  Therefore, there are no additional steps
required and this sample is no longer necessary.

Refer to the Ingress sample (../ingress/README.md) for information about
configuring access to the various monitoring web applications via Kubernetes ingress.

>***IMPORTANT NOTE: This Sample is Deprecated***

This sample will be removed at some point in the future.
