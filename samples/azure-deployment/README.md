# Deployment on Azure

This sample shows the customizations that are necessary if you deploy
on Microsoft Azure. The sample assumes that NGINX ingress is used, but you can
modify it for other solutions.

## Instructions

1. Copy this directory to a local directory.

2. If necessary, edit the `azuredisk-v4m.yaml` file to customize the
storage class that will be used for the deployment.

3. Edit the hostnames in the sample yaml files in both the `monitoring`
and `logging` subdirectories to match your environment's actual hostnames.

4. Add additional customization as desired.

5. Run this command to set the `USER_DIR` environment variable to the local path (change the command to use local path that you created in step 1):

```bash
export USER_DIR=path/to/my/copy/azure-deployment
```

6. Run this command:

```bash
`kubectl apply -f $USER_DIR/azuredisk-v4m.yaml`
```

7. Run the standard deployment scripts to deploy monitoring and logging components in Azure.

## Access the Applications

The monitoring and logging applications in this sample are configured for
path-based ingress and are available at (replace the hostnames for your deployment):

* `http://host.mycluster.example.com/grafana`
* `http://host.mycluster.example.com/prometheus`
* `http://host.mycluster.example.com/alertmanager`
* `http://host.mycluster.example.com/kibana`

For an example of using host-based ingress, see the [ingress sample](../ingress).
