# Minimal Logging Sample

This sample demonstrates how you can customize a logging deployment to minimize
resource usage. The sample deployment configures single instances of each
logging component. This configuration could save CPU and memory resources and
could be useful in development and test environments.

## Using This Sample

You customize your logging deployment by specifying values in `user.env` and
`*.yaml` files. These files are stored in a local directory outside of your
repository that is identified by the `USER_DIR` environment variable. See the
[logging README](../../logging/README.md#log_custom) for information about the
customization process.

The customization files in this sample provide a starting point for the
customization files for a deployment that supports logging that minimizes
resource usage. 

In order to use the values in this sample in the customization files for your
deployment, copy the customization files from this sample to your local
customization directory, then modify the files further as needed.

If you also need to use values from another sample, manually copy the values to
your customization files after you add the values in this sample.

After you finish modifying the customization files, deploy logging using the
standard deployment script:

```bash
my_repository_path/logging/bin/deploy_logging_open.sh
```
