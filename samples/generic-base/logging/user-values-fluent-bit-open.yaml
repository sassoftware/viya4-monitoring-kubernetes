# Resolving symbolic links/Relocated Docker Root Dir
#
# Uncomment the entire following section and edit
# the extraVolumeMounts and extraVolumes stanzas to
# ensure any symbolic links you have defined in your
# environment affecting the location of the container
# logs can be resolved.  This may include changes you
# made to relocate the Docker Root Directory.
#
# For example, in the sample below, the Docker
# Root Directory was mapped to: /data01/var/lib/docker
#
# If any symbolic links affecting the /var/log/containers
# directory cannot be resolved, Fluent Bit
# will run without ERRORs but NO log messages
# will be collected.
#
# NOTE: The extraVolumeMounts and extraVolumes entries
# related to parsers-config need to be uncommented as
# well but should not be edited beyond that.

#extraVolumeMounts:
#- mountPath: /fluent-bit/etc/viya-parsers.conf
#  name: parsers-config
#  subPath: viya-parsers.conf
#- mountPath: /data01/var/lib/docker/containers
#  name: path2dockercontainers
#  readOnly: true
#extraVolumes:
#- configMap:
#    defaultMode: 420
