# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set the values for the environment variables
#            AZMONITOR_CUSTOMER_ID and AZMONITOR_SHARED_KEY
#            here; set their values in the user.env file in
#            your USER_DIR directory.  If you must add additional
#            environment variables, uncomment the following lines
#            to ensure these two environment variables continue to
#            be set correctly and then add lines defining your
#            additional environment variables after them.
