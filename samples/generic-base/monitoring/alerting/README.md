# User-Provided Alerts, Contact Points and Notification Policies

You can use the `$USER_DIR/monitoring/alerting` directory to supply
a set of additional Grafana alerts to deploy with the monitoring
components.  You can also use the directory to define Grafana contact
points and notification policies . See [Add More Grafana Alerts](***NEED***LINK***) and
[Configure Contact Points, and Notification Policies](***NEED***LINK***) for details.
