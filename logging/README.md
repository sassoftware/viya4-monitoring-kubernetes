## Important Information about OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards

This project uses OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards and this has been
true since version 1.2.0 released in June of 2022.  Prior to that, the
project used Elasticsearch and Kibana.  To support backward compitibility,
some configuration options, environment variables, and other aspects of
this project still include references to those product names.  References
to Elasticsearch and Kibana should be understood to refer to OpenSearch
and OpenSearch Dashboards respectively.
